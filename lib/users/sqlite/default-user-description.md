My name is Andrei, a Romanian living in The Netherlands since 2017. 
A Javascript FullStack web developer, using NVim, Artix Linux + i3, loving POSIX shell scripting and the Unix philosophy. 
Big fan of the "less is more" approach, 80/20 solutions, and I'm always looking for ways to simplify and automate things.

Interested in compounding effects, functional programming, running, boxing, Taoism, Zettelkasten, pure functions, modeling things as a "left to right" pipeline where every point does a very specific action, the composition of these independent points giving the Answer.
